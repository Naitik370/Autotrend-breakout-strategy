# Trendline Breakout Strategy with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for implementing a trendline breakout trading strategy using machine learning (ML). The strategy involves identifying potential breakout points based on trendline analysis and using a machine learning model to filter trade signals.

## Files Included

- **trendline_automation.py**: Contains functions for fitting trendlines and optimizing slope parameters.
- **trendline_break_dataset.py**: Defines a function to generate a dataset for trendline breakout trading strategy.
- **walkforward_model.py**: Implements a walk-forward ML model to filter trade signals.
- **Trades**: Shows trades taken because of a trendline breakout.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - yfinance
  - pandas_ta
  - sklearn
  - mplfinance
  - plotly

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Naitik370/trendline-breakout-strategy.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries using pip.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## How It Works

The strategy works by:

- Identifying potential trendlines in price data.
- Defining breakout points based on breaches of these trendlines.
- Applying a machine learning model to filter trade signals and improve trade outcomes.
