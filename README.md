# Trendline Breakout Strategy with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for implementing a trendline breakout trading strategy using machine learning (ML). The strategy involves identifying potential breakout points based on trendline analysis and using a machine learning model to filter trade signals.

## Files Included

- **trendline_automation.py**: Contains functions for fitting trendlines and optimizing slope parameters.
- **trendline_break_dataset.py**: Defines a function to generate a dataset for trendline breakout trading strategy.
- **walkforward_model.py**: Implements a walk-forward ML model to filter trade signals.
- **Trades**: Shows trades taken because of a trendline breakout.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - yfinance
  - pandas_ta
  - sklearn
  - mplfinance
  - plotly

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trendline-breakout-strategy.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries using pip.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Example Usage**: Open and run the `example_usage.ipynb` notebook to see how to utilize the provided scripts.

## How It Works

The strategy works by:

- Identifying potential trendlines in price data.
- Defining breakout points based on breaches of these trendlines.
- Applying a machine learning model to filter trade signals and improve trade outcomes.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Use the scripts at your own risk, and always conduct thorough testing before applying any trading strategy in a live market environment.
